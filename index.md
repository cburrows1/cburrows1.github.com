Hello, I am Cameron Burrows. I graduated from the University of Florida with a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics in August 2022 with a 3.79 GPA. I am seeking employment as a software engineer, particularly in web development. I am experienced with software development principles involving agile processes, the MERN tech stack, automated unit testing, iterative programming, and more featured below. In my projects and employment, I like to write efficient and effective code with responsive designs.

Professionally and personally I value innovation, trust, passion, and connection. In my personal life, I am constantly trying to find ways to use my skills as a programmer to enhance my life or solve problems I encounter. For instance, I made a program to generate Spotify playlists with a specific tempo, and another application to visualize my Spotify music on my television. In the workplace, I try to foster trust and connection between myself and my peers allowing for a more peaceful and productive workplace, particularly when I’m in a position of leadership. Both personally and professionally I always bring a lot of energy and passion to whatever I’m working on, whether that’s grinding out a production-ready web platform for a client or training for my first triathlon. I consider my strengths to include being: dedicated, adventurous, communicative, flexible, and logical. I strive to infuse these values and strengths in everything I’m involved in.
