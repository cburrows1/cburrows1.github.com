Hello, I am Cameron Burrows. I graduated Cum Laude from the University of Florida with a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics in August 2022 with a 3.79 GPA. I am seeking employment as a software engineer, particularly in web development. I am experienced with software development principles involving full-stack development, agile processes, the MERN tech stack, automated unit testing, iterative programming, and more featured below. In my projects and employment, I like to write efficient and effective code with responsive designs.

One of my biggest strengths is my problem solving abilities and quick and efficient learning capabilities. I pride myself in my ability to thrive in new and challenging environments, and am excited to see what the future of my career holds for me. I also value communication, community, and teamwork personally and proffessionally. I am a very driven and passionate individual, and I am always looking for ways to improve myself and my skills.

I have recently taken time away from my career recently to backpack the Appalachian trail, travel, and connect with family. I am now more ready and eager than ever to start my career as a software engineer!
