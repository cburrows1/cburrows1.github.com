  description: |
    * **Personal project** built using **Spotify API** in Python.
    * This project solved a problem I found on Spotify where user-created running playlists that claimed to be 180 BPM were inaccurate and contained music I don't like as much as my own playlists.
    * I created a solution that accepts any Spotify playlist URLs, finds all songs in a certain BPM range, and adds them to a new playlist that I can listen to on my runs and workouts for a consistent tempo.

  description: |
    * Participated in a **hackathon** at Georgia Tech as a **full stack developer** (Robotech - Supporting Sustainability)
    * Rapidly brainstormed, outlined, and developed a project with a team of my peers that aims to identify and mitigate the effects of harmful algae blooms throughout waterways in Florida,
     supporting **sustainability** by requiring minimal oversight and materials to deploy.
    * Utilized **MERN + Typescript** tech stack to create both an appealing interface to monitor deployed algae detectors, and to create a robust backend to facilitate the collection and **processing of ML data** to the frontend.
    * Identified key algae predictive features from academic literature, found relevant datasets, preprocessed and **curated our own training/testing dataset**.
     Finally **trained a Python Keras model** to recognize potential algae blooms from easily testable features in waterways.

  description: |
    * Developed a **deep learning image project** to classify invasive Florida fish images aiding in wildlife preservation.
    * **Curated a dataset** by scraping invasive and non-invasive fish lists and images from the internet, hand selecting the best images, and normalizing the images.
    * **Fine tuned a Keras ImageNet model** by first applying data augmentation to the training dataset, transfer learning on the model, and finally fine tuning the model.
    * **Tested** the model on a separate dataset to verify model effectiveness.
    * **Learned** dataset creation pipeline, deep learning concepts/algorithms, model training challenges, effective testing and analysis.

  link: https://github.com/chburrows/stringArtWeaver
  description: |
    * **Personal project** written in **Python** that generates the instructions needed to represent a digital image physically with only pegs on a board and a single continuous string strung between them (many times).
    * Accepts any **rectangular shaped canvas** and any quantity of pegs on board perimeter.
    * The image and associated instructions are calculated by a **brute force search** of the image to find the single darkest path between the current peg and the next one,
     eventually creating contrast between the darker areas with more string and the more sparse regions.
    * This project satisfied my desire to combine a **creative physical artistic interest** with my **programming skills and interests**.
